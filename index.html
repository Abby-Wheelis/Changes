<h3>What is the fundamental difference between the data discussed in chapter 7 and the data discussed in chapter 8?</h3>
<p>
   The fundamental differenct between the data discussed in chapters 7 and 8 is that in chapter 8, the data being explored is that the data in chapter 8 is representing change over time. However, it is still important to visualize both types of data in order to anylyze trends, even though the trends may be very different.

<h3>What are the pro's and cons of 3 visualizations techniques discussed in chapter 8?</h3>
    
<ol>
<li>Time Series Line Charts:
    <ul>
        <li>This technique plots equally spaced time intervals on the x axis and the magnitude of the variable that you wish to represent on the y axis.</li>
        <li>These charts allow for the general trends in the data to be seen.</li>
        <li>However, it makes it difficult for the extra noise to be avoided and sometimes allows the viewer to miss kew cyclical patterns that help explain the data.</li>
        <li>Adding a moving average curve or index origin, amoung other strategies can help to make this chart more useful and help to show trends.</li>
    </ul>
</li> 
    
<li>Seasonal Subseries Chart
    <ul>
        <li>These charts compare values at the same points in the cycle for cyclical data.</li>
        <li>This is useful to compare cyclical relationships, so that the values for each of these cycles can be compared, such as employment in July every year.</li>
        <li>This makes it easy to see if data is cyclical or not.</li>
        <li>However, it is not possible to see all of the trends in the data because it is broken up.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
    
<li> Logarithmic Scale
   <ul>
        <li>A logarithmic scale can be applied to the variable that is represented on the y axis to make an exponential data set linear.</li>
       <li>This allows you to determine if a data set is exponential.</li>
       <li>However, it may downplay other variations in the data which may need to be examined.</li>
    </ul> 
</li>
